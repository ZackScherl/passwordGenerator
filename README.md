My First Password Generator, An Intro to Javascript

The starter code was sourced from 
The Coding Bootcamp repo: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet

I followed advice from Paul Keldson's youtube guide for advice on pseudocoding and using decomposition on the tasks at hand

Michell Brito provided tutoring advice as I became stuck on getting my password to populate - I had a mistake on lines 39-42, she helped me
understand the use of .push(...)

I also will make sure to add more commits in between steps. I created submodules and had to clone my code to escape that conflict.
